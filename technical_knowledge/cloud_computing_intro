Hypervisor: firmware/low-level program acts as a Virtual Machine Manager. It allows to share the single physical instance of cloud resources between several tenants( kiraidaro/ bharatiya ).
Management Software:   It helps to maintain and configure the infrastructure

Deployment Software: It helps to deploy and integrate the application on the cloud.

Deployment Model: Public cloud / private cloud / Hybrid Cloud /Community Cloud 


Service Model: 
1. infrastructure as a service (IAAS)
2. Platform as a service (PAAS)
3. Software as a service (SAAS)
4. Identify as a service (IDAAS)
5. Network as a service (NAAS)


IAAS: ex: AWS_EC2
 Provides - 
 a. Physical Machines
 b. Virtual storage
 c. Virtual Local Area Network (VLANs)
 d. Load Balancer
 e. Ip addresses
 f. Software bundles
 All of the above resources are made available to end user via server virtualization. Moreover, these resources are accessed by the customers as if they own them. (Virtual Machine Automation)
 
PAAS: ex: AMAZON WEB SERVICES, MICROSOFT AZURE, AWS ELASTIC BEANSTALK, HEROKU, FORCE.COM, GOOGLE APP ENGINE, APACHE STRATOS, OPENSHIFT
 Provides - 
 a. runtime environment for application
 b. development and deployment tools
 c. point-and-click for non developer
 d. App Engine of Google and Force.com are examples of PaaS offering vendors. ()

SAAS: Gmail, hotmail, google docs
 Provides -
 a. software application to end users.(billing and invoicing system/CRM application,help desk,HR solutions)

IDAS:
 Provides -
 a. 

NAAS:
 Provides - 
 a. custom routing protocols
