#LARGER SENSOR, LARGER COLLECTION OF LIGHT

FACTS:
	LARGER SENSOR IS BETTER AT COLLECTING MUCH INFORMATION @smartphone sensor size are small
	LARGER PIXEL SIZE IS BETTER TARGET FOR PHOTON HITS @smartphone pizel size are tiny, so if miss a photon capture that will be a black pixel. 
	so Boosting image sensitivity (ISO) will make higher chance of capturing photon but then more noice will be captured.
	the statistical distribution of photons starts to matter.
	As light passes though an aperture, it spreads out â€” it blurs.APERTURE is the hole for passing light, then light falls at the lens
	the wider aperture the less blurring
	sensor pixel size(eg 48Mp) may not be useful if dont have a proper lens, so  maybe smartphone company marketing strategy
	So smartphone does software tricks 
	HIGHER ISO MAKE NOISE, so CAPTURING MULTIPLE PHOTOS AND TAKING AVERAGE WILL IMPROVE THE NOISE
	
	CAMERA SOFTWARE TRICKS:
		HDR
		SMART HDR : exposure steps are counted by AI chip
		google's night sight mode: how fast to set the exposure based on the camera holder motion and lighting and shoots many images like pro capture 
		and holds in a circular buffer and based on exposure length and selected some images using AI and then creates the single image.
		PRO CAPTURE: SHOOT MANY IMAGES and stacks on ram BEFORE COMPLETION OF SHUTTER BUTTON so that you can't miss a shot
		digital darkroom = raw image+processing, capture raw image and edit in photoshop
		google best shot
		
	#WHY HIGHER MEGA PIXEL? EVEN MAXIMUM DISPLAY IS 4K or 3840 x 2160 = 8294400 or ~8.3MP
