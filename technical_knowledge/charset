all characters of all scripts
Glyphs uses the hexadecimal UTF-16 convention
Unicode has seventeen planes of 65,536 characters each
the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP or Plane 0) ranging from U+0000 to U+FFFF and the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP or Plane 1) from U+10000 to U+1FFFF
Planes are subdivided in many character blocks, usually comprising a script, e.g. Tamil from U+0B80 to U+0BFF or something funny like Emoticons (starting at U+1F600)
 
Not all (17×65,536=) 1,114,112 code points of Unicode are currently in use. At the time of writing, the latest Unicode standard was version 11.0.0 from June 2018 with 137,374 characters. Some parts of Unicode are intentionally left free for private use. Unicode knows three such Private Use Areas (PUA), the most important one ranging from U+E000 to U+F8FF.

Unicode Script
 Some scripts support one and only one writing system and language
 For example, the Vietnamese writing system is supported by the Latin scripts
 A writing system may also cover more than one script, for example the Japanese writing system makes use of the Han, Hiragana and Katakana scripts.
