collaboration between CELLS and PROTEINS.

CELLS travel through the BLOODSTREAMS or in speicalized vessels called LYMPHATICS.

LYMPHNODES and the SPLEEN provide structures that facilitate CELL-to-CELL communication. 

the BONEMARROW and THYMUS represent training grounds for two CELLS of the immune system. (B-CELLS and T-CELLS).

the development of all CELLS of the immune system begins in the BONEMARROW with a HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL. the CELL is called STEM because all the other
speicalized CELLS arise from it.

the INNATE immune system and the ADAPTIVE immune system.

INNATE immune responses are those that rely on CELLS that require no additional "training" to do thier jobs.
these CELLS includes NEUTROPHILS, MONOCYTES, NATURAL KILLER(NK) CELLS and a set of PROTEINS termed the COMPLEMENT PROTEINS.

ADAPTIVE immune responses  involve T-CELLS and B-CELLS, two CELL type that require "training" or education to learn not to attack our own CELLS. the advantages of
the ADAPTIVE responses are their long-lived memory and the ability to adapt to new GERMS.


both types have ability to distinguish foreign invaders.
the INNATE responses are usually the first to respond to an "invasion" this initial response serves to alert and trigger the ADAPTIVE response which can take 
several days to fully activate.

newborn babies do have ANTIBODIES from their mother but do not make thier own ANTIBODIES for several weeks.
