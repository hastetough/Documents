GOOGLE BRAND ACC SAME LIKE FACEBOOK  PAGE 
the gmail can be send using smtp library without any api but for that you have to enable less secure app in the gmail setting
all google api https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer

HOW GOOGLE API WORKS:
	1. create or select a project in cloud console (dont activate for paid or trial)
	2. create credentials by selecting client app type, for ex: android app, desktop app etc and download the json which can be used by the client program
	3. register an APP and create OAuth consent screen (internal and external app) 	
	4. enable a API
	5. also when run the client program it will redirect to Auth screen for continue and upon finish it will send acknowledge to that program (using localhost 
	   and a port)
	6. upon finished the client program will save a token.json file and later can be used by the program without resigning
