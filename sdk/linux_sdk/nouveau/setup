	outputs that my graphics card is NVIDIA GEFORCE 820M based on fermi architecture with 2.1 compute capability (not NVIDIA GEFORCE GT 820M) and inside it there is a  NVIDIA GF117M GPU
	My graphics card is a hybrid graphics card,because I have intel graphics card inside and also Nvidia graphics card.
	Hardware generation vs compute capability and cuda support
supported technology
	CUDA 2.1
	Optimus       :allows an Intel integrated GPU and discrete NVIDIA GPU to be built into and accessed by a laptop. (bumblebee)
	Physx
	GPU Boost 2.0
	DirectX 12
	OpenGL 4.5


CUDA SDK 8.0 support for compute capability 2.0 â€“ 6.x (Fermi, Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal). Last version with support for compute capability 2.x (Fermi) (Pascal GTX 1070Ti Not Supported).


3  methods:
	use intel graphics only
	use NVIDIA graphics only
	use NVIDIA GPU when needed and keep it powered off to save power
		using prime render offload
		using optimus-manager
		using nvidia-xrun
		using bumblebee : Allows application with NVIDIA
		using nouveau
		




Bumblebee is a software implementation comprising two parts:
    1. Render programs off-screen on the dedicated video card and display it on the screen using the integrated video card. This bridge is provided by VirtualGL or 
    primus (read further) and connects to a X server started for the discrete video card.
    
    2. Disable the dedicated video card when it is not in use (see the #Power management section)

install: 
	bumblebee 
	mesa:  An open-source implementation of the OpenGL specification.
	mesa-demos : use glxgears to test if if Bumblebee works with your Optimus system
	xf86-video-intel
	Xorg
	lib32-virtualgl
	lib32-nvidia-utils
	nvidia:
		The NVIDIA GeForce 820M actually uses nvidia-390xx-{dkms,utils}
	
	
    
### yay -S nvidia-390xx-dkms nvidia-smi works
# sudo pacman -S mesa-demos
# sudo pacman -S mesa
# sudo pacman -S lib32-mesa
# sudo pacman -S xf86-video-nouveau
# modprobe nouveau
# rmmod nvidia

# sudo pacman -S bumblebee  optirun glxgears  and optirun glxspheres64 and alternatives primusrun and pvkrun
# sudo pacman -S xf86-video-intel
