IMBA Installation:
using NPM manager. where node.js is also necessary. go to the extracted imba directory and hit #npm-install

	or	
	
sudo npm install -g imba
/usr/bin/imba -> /usr/lib/node_modules/imba/bin/imba
/usr/bin/imbac -> /usr/lib/node_modules/imba/bin/imbac
/usr/bin/imbapack -> /usr/lib/node_modules/imba/bin/imbapack   #npm install -g webpack it takes all the code from your application and makes it usable in a web browser

place the index.js file to src/index.js

need module loader-utils
then run imbapack
created a folder called dist/main.js
in main.js it's so messy
imbapack --watch --serve --hmr this command continiously does that (imbapack) whereever there's a change in that index.js file

manual entry point imbapack --entry ./src/index.js   and webpack/imbapack uses loader to handle these types of file
for ex: html-webpack-plugin generates an HTML file for your application by injecting automatically all your generated bundles.


here /usr/lib/node_modules is the global node modules directory

like for Composer for PHP


step1: npm init -y # creates a package.json file

in that file we can add dependencis like:
"dependencies": {
    "webpack": "^3.6.0"
  }
  also
  "scripts": {
   "start": "webpack"
  }
  now when npm start , it will trigger the webpack command


step2: create webpack.config.js #without this file works too.
the file is look like this

const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: 'index.html',
      title: 'HTML Webpack Plugin'
    })
  ]
};



since the package imbapack is good as webpack
so, we will use imbapack, and all the global modules will be parsed by this. but not using webpack


recap:
imbac : compile the .imba to .js
imbapack : convert the js to browser understandable js

then install npm install -g concurrently
it looks like this in package.json under scripts
"dev": "concurrently --kill-others \"npm run start-watch\" \"npm run wp-server\""
and just can use
npm run dev
--mode development for imbapack
