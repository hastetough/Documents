WHY DEVELOPER ACCOUNT WITH AN FACEBOOK APP IS REQUIRED FOR USER TOKEN? SO THAT UNKNOWN SOFTWARE CAN'T USE SIGNIN FROM FACEBOOK TO GET ACCESS TOKEN.
the login with facebook works by signin facebook through the "FB APP" reference by giving it the permissions and both software and FB APP store the access token.
So, the APP ADMIN can do some task on those signed in users too.
then we have app roles(ADMIN,DEVELOPER,TESTER,ANALYTICS USER)
then we have app permissions: to allow some permission in the app, admin must ask facebook so they grant, because misuse of permission can be happen. it's like verify the app. facebook calls it App Review
