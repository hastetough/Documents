GSI(Generic System Image), purest form of android framework built from AOSP(android open source project)   

there will a vendor(gsi compatible) implementation for the device. and so there will be a boundary between vendor(hardware related) and the android  framework. 

but for unofficial Treble device like the Mi A1(ARM64), it's our (tissot(codename) OEM(xiaomi) developers) responsibility to make a Vendor/Kernel that is as GSI-compatible as possible.

" The system image of an Android device is replaced with a GSI then tested with the Vendor Test Suite (VTS) and the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) to ensure that the device implements vendor interfaces correctly with the latest version of Android. "

wrapping this up.   we need the vendor image and the latest GSI.
but for mi-a1 we need to repartition the user data to a vendor and user data then install a treble ROM (AIO) then the GSI.
twrp uses .ZIP file to install. this are little special than img files.

GSI CONFIGURATION: [current]
	devices that uses HIDL vendor Interfaces.
	Device must have a method for disabling verify boot.
	uses ext4 file system.
	uses system-as-root partition layout
	ARM,X86,etc and cpu bitness 32 or 64
GSI TARGETS FOR TREBLE COMPLIANCE TESTS:
	 The GSI used for compliance testing is determined by the Android version that the device launches with. 
	          Device type 					     Build target
	Devices launching with Android 10 			aosp_$arch-user
	Devices launching with Android 9 			aosp_$arch-userdebug
	Devices launching with Android 8.0 or Android 8.1 	aosp_$arch_ab-userdebug

VENDOR BINARIES AND VNDK DEPENDENCIES:

BUILD GSI:

custom rom such as RR, Lineage os comes with GSI compatible vendor(treble version). they are called ALLINONE. but there should be a VENDOR partition.

RESULTS:
	slot_a twrp image patched
	slot_b twrp image patched

FORMATTING USER DATA
	vendor_a
	vendor_b

our twrp is installed in slot_a or slot_b
right now both AIO and TWRP is installed in slot_b and slot_b is active
so if it loops then try "fastboot --set-active=a"
GSI should go in slot_b too.(using the system img)
now old resurection system will get removed and new GSI will take cover. it's taking time.
